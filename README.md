"heaps" aims to be a Python module for FreeCAD aimed to simplify mergings of models into the active project. The relevant workbench will be "heapsOstuff".

The basic idea is to gather into .xml files (called "heaps" in the slang of this module) the references to the files frequently imported ("things") and organize them in categories ("stuff").
At the end you'll just need to pick a thing from the stuff of a heap and place it in your project.
